<p><a href="#">Delivery</a>&nbsp;is Monday to Friday, between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m., local time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Standard shipping is the default shipping method for most&nbsp;products&nbsp;under 100 lbs and includes delivery by a small parcel carrier.</p>
<p>Your order will be delivered to the closest dry area outside your home; typically the front door, porch or driveway.&nbsp;Shipments will be delivered as an NSR (No Signature Required).</p>
<p>Some geographic service restrictions apply. In certain remote locations, delivery will be made to the courier's closest&nbsp;pick-up centre&nbsp;from the shipment destination.</p>
<p>Multiple&nbsp;products&nbsp;may be shipped at different times due to the size of the&nbsp;product&nbsp;or the location that it ships from. If any single package in your order exceeds 31.8 kg (70 lbs), assistance to unload your order may be required when it arrives.</p>
<p>Shipments to the Territories (Yukon, NWT, Nunavut) may be possible, but will require contacting <a>Customer Support</a> at <a>1-800-628-0525</a> to obtain a shipping quote.</p>
